" "And why?" "Because we are floating in space, my dear captain, and in space bodies fall or move (which is the same thing) with equal speed whatever be their weight or form; it is the air, which by its resistance creates these differences in weight.
Ah! if Raphael had seen us thus, what an `Assumption' he would have thrown upon canvas!" "The `Assumption' cannot last," replied Barbicane.
At the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth assigned for that lapse of time, namely, 112 feet.
There the Nautilus generally drifted at a depth between 100 and 200 meters.
Some magic lay behind this dazzling sight! Perhaps some atmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon? Perhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves? But only a few meters down, the Nautilus felt no tempest's fury, and the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters.
The level seafloor rose imperceptibly.

] O true apothecary! Thy drugs are quick.
] Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock, and a crow of iron.
How could electricity work with such power? Where did this nearly unlimited energy originate? Was it in the extraordinary voltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil? Could its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some unknown system of levers?** This was the point I couldn't grasp.
He requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in accordance with the present invitation.
when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town, made their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek.
I ate and then fell asleep.

It's completely decked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in place by bolts.
On the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very center of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular hole sixty feet in diameter.
" This arrangement subjected all objects to but one reflection, making the view consequently much clearer; the result was that, when they were taking observation, J.
CHAPTER XVIII THE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA If this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires, had simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane would not have hesitated a moment.
But what I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal waters of these strata.
He had grown fat! CHAPTER XXIV THE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS On the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of the subscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the Observatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction of a gigantic optical instrument.
It went along the 50th meridian with considerable speed.
But the projectile must describe a curve unalterably determined by the laws of mechanical reasoning.
The rivalry will descend from State to city, and so on downward.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
Go below!" The Canadian, Conseil, and I could only obey.
But having gone past the shallows of the Strait of Sicily, the Nautilus resumed its usual deep-water speed.
Kindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system of classification.
Well now! In 1868, on this 21st day of March, I myself, Captain Nemo, have reached the South Pole at 90 degrees, and I hereby claim this entire part of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents.
Noises from deep underneath, clearly transmitted by the liquid medium, reverberated with majestic amplitude.
Here and there stood sharp peaks, lean spires that rose as high as 200 feet; farther off, a succession of steeply cut cliffs sporting a grayish tint, huge mirrors that reflected the sparse rays of a sun half drowned in mist.
" "You are right, sir," struck in Murchison, the engineer; "and, if I mistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.
" "By Jove!" exclaimed Michel; "I should be nothing more than a pigmy, a shrimp!" "Gulliver with the giants," said Nicholl.
Verne regards the sea from many angles: in the domain of marine biology, he gives us thumbnail sketches of fish, seashells, coral, sometimes in great catalogs that swirl past like musical cascades; in the realm of geology, he studies volcanoes literally inside and out; in the world of commerce, he celebrates the high-energy entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable or dig the Suez Canal.
Yes, he is dead: How wilt thou do for a Father? Son.
" "Then we have ample time to finish our voyage," Conseil replied, "if Ned Land doesn't mess things up!" Thus reassured, Conseil went back to studying the shallows that the Nautilus was skimming at moderate speed.
Instead of breathing it themselves, they had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured life into me drop by drop! I tried to push the device away.
" "Fair enough, captain, but if we're going to see, we need light to drive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters, I wonder how your helmsman can--" "Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector whose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile.
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
I found a place near him and waited without speaking.
"How time goes," said Michel, "in the conversation of scientific men such as we are! Certainly, I feel I know too much! I feel that I am becoming a well!" Saying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile, "to observe the moon better," he pretended.
The next day, January 6: nothing new on board.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman's side to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction.
Stunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind.

" "Could you quote them to me, so I can double-check them as the need arises?" "Here," I replied, "are a few of them that stick in my memory.
The same thought seemed to occur to Ardan; and both were casting inquiring glances on Nicholl, when suddenly Maston paused.
Suddenly, just as on the previous evening, Ned Land's voice was audible.

So, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an underwater Monitor was ultimately rejected.
A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves, but sorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes to prevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay! I counted four of them--four men, one still standing at the helm-- then a woman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck, holding a child in her arms.

All these men had but one thought.
Was't not the way? 3.
The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and the diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6,400 times, and required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the purpose of working it, its weight being twelve and a half tons.
But this hardly mattered so long as the lower surface kept growing thinner.
He added that it arose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot, and, finally, that the scene at the meeting was only the long-wished-for opportunity for Nicholl to pay off an old grudge.
Did it still have comparable surprises in store for me? I felt sure it did, so inexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders! As it was, in the five and a half months since fate had brought us on board, we had cleared 14,000 leagues, and over this track longer than the earth's equator, so many fascinating or frightening incidents had beguiled our voyage: that hunting trip in the Crespo forests, our running aground in the Torres Strait, the coral cemetery, the pearl fisheries of Ceylon, the Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorini, those millions in the Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the South Pole! During the night all these memories crossed over from one dream to the next, not giving my brain a moment's rest.
" CHAPTER XIV PICKAXE AND TROWEL The same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town; and Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the Tampico for New Orleans.
The roads aren't terribly well kept up.
We'll return in our tracks and go out the southern opening.
To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most famous poet, Victor Hugo, author of The Toilers of the Sea.
He didn't address a word to me.
They were examining the ship's circumstances, exchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect.
Michel Ardan was muttering: "That is just like these scientific men: they never do anything else.

And soon this mist began to condense into snow.
"Patience!" exclaimed Ardan.
Carried away with its driving power, the Nautilus had passed through the vessel's mass like a sailmaker's needle through canvas! I couldn't hold still.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back; Happiness courts thee in her best array; But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench, Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
A glass cover, six inches thick and strengthened with upper fastenings, closed it tightly.
Not far from that, rose to a height of 17,400 feet the annular mountain of Short, equal to the Asiatic Caucasus.

In any event, I thought it best to let him have his chat, and we all three went to sit next to the beacon, where we were less exposed to the damp spray from the billows.
It also got more unpredictable, often taking us to great depths.
The liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters or crabs weighing 200 metric tons! Why not? Formerly, in prehistoric days, land animals (quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a gigantic scale.
Only the propeller's vibrations disturbed the deep silence reigning on board.
Captain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a musical trance.
A struggle of the elements was approaching.
"Most of these dishes are new to you," he told me.
Conseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates, and although his catalog is a little dry, I wouldn't want to wrong the gallant lad by leaving out his personal observations.
Foul Weather XXVIII.
Sometimes I go hunting right in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of man's reach, and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests.
And they represented an enormous sum of money.
Welcome aboard, professor.
At this point the propeller's vibrations slowed down appreciably, then they died out altogether.
And what a way to die! Smashed, strangled, crushed by the fearsome arms of a devilfish, ground between its iron mandibles, this friend would never rest with his companions in the placid waters of their coral cemetery! As for me, what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this struggle was the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man.
Under the centripetal force, the base of the projectile tended toward the moon; but the centrifugal still prevailed; and it was probable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a curve of some sort, the nature of which they could not at present determine.
They did not again leave the scuttles, and noted every detail of this fantastical continent.
We were being swept westward, and I estimate that our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per hour.
It carried seventy-four cannons and was launched in 1762.
In essence, the Mediterranean receives a continual influx of water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it; since local evaporation isn't enough to restore the balance, the total amount of added water should make this sea's level higher every year.
Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass the point of equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
It was ten o'clock in the morning.
Fish rose in a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass.
I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him to postpone his attempt.
Just then the Nautilus had arrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall.
Why had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this underwater crypt? I would soon find out.

I understood his fear.
"The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?" I asked.
It was a ringed mountain nine thousand feet high, and one of those circles so numerous on this satellite.
" "By thunder, sir!" Ned Land exclaimed.
" "Nor I, sir," Captain Nemo answered me.
Sliding under our hull, this block then raised us with irresistible power, lifting us into less congested strata where we now lie on our side.
These classes are the Crustacea, Cirripedia, and Annelida.
"It won't be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel.
One hour more, and the point of equal attraction would be reached.
In America, all is easy, all is simple; and as for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise.
I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts.
Other plates, closely fitted, covered the lenticular glasses, and the travelers, hermetically enclosed in their metal prison, were plunged in profound darkness.
And indeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could it move about with such prodigious speed? Also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other enormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement.

I regarded him with a mixture of fear and fascination, in the same way, no doubt, that Oedipus regarded the Sphinx.
But the depths were deserted.
When the Nautilus passed between them, covering them with sheets of electricity, they seemed ready to salute us with their colors and send us their serial numbers! But no, nothing but silence and death filled this field of catastrophes! I observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more cluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer to the Strait of Gibraltar.
So we can't rely on nature to rescue us, only our own efforts.
Exit crying Murther.
" "So be it," said Michel; "but, once more; how could they calculate the initiatory speed?" "Nothing can be easier," replied Barbicane.

Let us at present examine the velocities hitherto attained.
Light and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass scuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the bottom, the fourth in the top.
"I've given orders to open the hatches.
As soon as ever Barbicane invented a new shot, Nicholl invented a new plate; each followed a current of ideas essentially opposed to the other.
To my deep astonishment, Captain Nemo gave him a signal.

Friar Laurence's cell.
The bold travelers being borne away into gloomy space, without their accustomed _cortege_ of rays, felt a vague uneasiness in their hearts.
It is needless to say that a scale would not show this loss; for the weight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly as much as the object itself; but a spring steelyard for example, the tension of which was independent of the attraction, would have given a just estimate of this loss.
By then the darkness was profound, and as good as the Canadian's eyes were, I still wondered how he could see--and what he had seen.
As soon as the moon rose above the horizon, he immediately caught her in the field of the telescope; he never let her go for an instant out of his sight, and followed her assiduously in her course through the stellar spaces.

This scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel very impatient.
A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment.
" The little watery vapor enclosed in the projectile mixing with the air tempered the dryness; and many apartments in London, Paris, or New York, and many theaters, were certainly not in such a healthy condition.
When the monster's detractors cited a saying by the botanist Linnaeus that "nature doesn't make leaps," witty writers in the popular periodicals parodied it, maintaining in essence that "nature doesn't make lunatics," and ordering their contemporaries never to give the lie to nature by believing in krakens, sea serpents, "Moby Dicks," and other all-out efforts from drunken seamen.
Certain authors have even held that the many weeds strewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that ancient continent.
