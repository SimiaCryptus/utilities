" Jules Verne (1828-1905) published the French equivalents of these words in 1869, and little has changed since.
Our chief officer loaded the blunderbusses, which can launch harpoons as far as a mile, and long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound even the most powerful animals.
" "So it's outside?" "Surely.
Ardan mounted a platform, from the top of which his view extended over a sea of black hats.
Every one who had subscribed to the Gun Club was directly interested in the welfare of the travelers.
Suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull.
"So," the captain went on, "when the Nautilus lies on the waves under these conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water.
I'll find Romeo To comfort you.
I was in practice for several years before joining the museum.

The hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience.
I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that Which might appall the Diuell La.
Like a covey of snipe over a marsh, there rose underfoot schools of unusual fish from the genus Monopterus, whose members have no fin but their tail.
But I haue none.
"Professor Aronnax," he told me, "this calls for heroic measures, or we'll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement.
His grief was immense.
Now I ask you, after it had been wounded west of America, how could this animal be killed in the east, unless it had cleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope?" "I agree with our friend Ned," Conseil said, "and I'm waiting to hear how master will reply to him.
Consequently, under these conditions it needed to displace only nine-tenths of its volume, hence 1,356.
The next day, June 1, the Nautilus kept to the same tack.
At this point, a body having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would remain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs, and not being drawn more toward one than toward the other.
"Ned Land!" he called.
For the rest, he was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet, like those little figures which they sell for children's toys.
Yet there was no shortage of water under its keel, since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters; but these waterways, strewn with islands and plowed by steamers, probably didn't agree with Captain Nemo.
The harpooner's family originated in Quebec, and they were already a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still belonged to France.
Just as I pushed open the door leading to the well of the central companionway, I heard the hatch close sharply overhead.
" At this moment Diana joined in the conversation by a sonorous barking.
We must here make one important remark with regard to the map by which they were taking observations.
"Since we're deep in the ocean, being inside this boat is vastly preferable to being above it or below it!" "But we fix things by kicking out all the jailers, guards, and wardens," Ned Land added.
To those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they demonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being that of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution round the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of time, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days.
Clear?" "Clear," I replied.
First division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been created by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose usefulness is beyond dispute.

Charles Darwin, who thus explains the formation of atolls--a theory superior, in my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit on the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet below sea level.
He assigned a height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean of the different altitudes to little more than 2,400 feet.
They were spurring each other on.
They gave each other reasons bristling with _x_.

"Ye gods, I'll sleep soundly," Conseil said.
Nevertheless, their fantastic friend was a little in the right.
Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
Obviously some sleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we'd just eaten! So imprisonment wasn't enough to conceal Captain Nemo's plans from us-- sleep was needed as well! Then I heard the hatches close.
"Do you understand it at last?" asked Barbicane.
My blood turned cold in my veins! I saw that we were under threat from a fearsome pair of sharks.
"Then it's an air gun?" "Surely.
A dense crowd soon assembled on the quay, waiting for them to disembark.
But I was aware that my death throes had begun.
Deep down, I was determined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me on board the Nautilus.
"All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend! Bony fish are subdivided into six orders.
At this rate, it was obvious that we would never catch up with it.
The mist had cleared, and on that day I hoped our noon sights could be accomplished.
" Arriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory, I could see vast white plains covered with walruses.
Undoubtedly people now knew where they stood on the existence of this so-called monster.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow? Mother.
"You mean beat us to a fare-thee-well!" "Let's not exaggerate, Mr.
In essence, manatees, like seals, are designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the clusters of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.
Reiset and Regnaut's apparatus worked with great regularity.
Barbicane sought to restrain them.
"Gentlemen," resumed the orator, "I repeat that the distance between the earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of serious consideration.
For seven months we've been aboard your vessel, and I ask you today, in the name of my companions as well as myself, if you intend to keep us here forever.
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry In what I farther shall intend to do, By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
Sweet, so would I.
" "You are certain of this amount?" broke in Barbicane.
This is as't should be.
With his eye and his throwing arm, he was worth the whole crew all by himself.
" And they did not subscribe a single farthing.
Then the iron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil; a kind of rock formed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks could with difficulty penetrate.
"You see, old fellow," he said, "you must not take what I say in bad part; but really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a condition to appear in the moon!" "Incomplete?" shrieked the valiant invalid.
I couldn't stand still.
"I like," retorted Michel Ardan, "to explain what you savants cannot explain; at least my hypotheses has the advantage of indicating why these rifts disappear, or seem to disappear, at certain seasons.
"I only need twenty-five minutes to serve you one of my own special creations.
About the 15th of August the vapors ejected had sensibly diminished in intensity and thickness.
" "And how will you prepare it?" I asked the Canadian.
"And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows?" he asked me in a gently ironic tone.
Then the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus, returning beneath the arches of the forest, through the thickets, along the coral bushes, going steadily higher.
In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up and decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into planets.
Most had counted upon witnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to nothing but smoke.
At this moment the projectile emerged from the conical shadow cast by the terrestrial globe, and the rays of the radiant orb struck the lower disc of the projectile direct occasioned by the angle which the moon's orbit makes with that of the earth.
So I have to wait for the arrival of a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from North Cape.
Who could advance objections against conscientious observers, who at less than twenty-four miles distance had marked that curious mountain of Tycho, the strangest system of lunar orography? How answer those savants whose sight had penetrated the abyss of Pluto's circle? How contradict those bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had borne over that invisible face of the disc, which no human eye until then had ever seen? It was now their turn to impose some limit on that selenographic science, which had reconstructed the lunar world as Cuvier did the skeleton of a fossil, and say, "The moon _was_ this, a habitable world, inhabited before the earth.
During this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near the Nautilus, but they weren't boisterous.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
" "We shall not be able to reach the neutral point.
I also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three centimeters long, which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands in one gulp.
The sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around the Nautilus.
We were racing north-northeast with frightful speed, fifty meters down.
Hazy flickerings were reflected on its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit.
If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well, It were done quickly: If th' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow Might be the be all, and the end all.

If the projectile was to gravitate round the satellite in an elliptical orbit, why was not its heaviest part turned toward it, as the moon turns hers to the earth? That was a difficult point.
Once it was abreast of Cape Horn, I thought it would strike west of the cape, make for Pacific seas, and complete its tour of the world.
Calculate, then, how much resistance of bone structure and strength of constitution they'd need in order to withstand such pressures!" "They'd need to be manufactured," Ned Land replied, "from sheet-iron plates eight inches thick, like ironclad frigates.
org, I will still see it, if it bounces from prairienet.
Its navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school of squid, unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish.
Besides, an escape attempt might be timely if we were in sight of the coasts of England or Provence, but in the waterways of Papua it's another story.

"How time goes," said Michel, "in the conversation of scientific men such as we are! Certainly, I feel I know too much! I feel that I am becoming a well!" Saying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile, "to observe the moon better," he pretended.
I, that he was Son.
A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves, but sorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes to prevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay! I counted four of them--four men, one still standing at the helm-- then a woman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck, holding a child in her arms.

" "Captain, I hear you, but I can't believe my ears.
"But I imagine you have pressing reasons for looking me up?" "Very pressing.
He requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in accordance with the present invitation.
Besides, even without these conditions, life was possible.
Next, natural towers with wide, steeply carved battlements leaned at angles that, on dry land, the laws of gravity would never have authorized.
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily That we have had no time to move our daughter.
As for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut, that had to be renounced completely.
" "But," I asked, "are we at least back on the surface of the sea?" "We have no idea," Conseil replied.

The length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters, and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters.
This incident was more than a cosmical phenomenon; it was a threatened danger, the consequence of which might be disastrous in the extreme.
Yet for the imaginings of these storytellers there had to be, if not a cause, at least an excuse.

" "I've no more objections to raise," I replied.
I would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced Captain Nemo to take us into this gulf.
Near eleven o'clock in the morning, we cleared the lower slopes of the mountains that form the island's center, and we still hadn't bagged a thing.
"Yes, my boy, it's a left-handed shell!" "A left-handed shell!" Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.
After what they had seen, could the travelers solve it? Would they decide for or against it? Michel Ardan persuaded his two friends to form an opinion, and asked them directly if they thought that men and animals were represented in the lunar world.
This murtherous Shaft that's shot, Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way, Is to auoid the ayme.
Captain Nemo had just activated his electric device.
From that we may draw five good reasons for supposing that the lunar projectile, if ever launched, is now at the bottom of the Atlantic or the Pacific, unless it sped into some crevasse at that period when the crust of the earth was not yet hardened.
Th'art kinde 3.
This body revolved upon its axis, and exhibited the phenomena of all celestial bodies abandoned in space.

Maston abusing the learned Belfast as usual, who was by his side; the secretary of the Gun Club maintaining for the thousandth time that he had just seen the projectile, and adding that he could see Michel Ardan's face looking through one of the scuttles, at the same time enforcing his argument by a series of gestures which his formidable hook rendered very unpleasant.
Here are some preserves of sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled in the entire world, here's cream from milk furnished by the udders of cetaceans, and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea; and finally, allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone, equal to that from the tastiest fruits.

Diving-dresses were also prepared, which through this impervious covering allowed the divers to observe the bottom of the sea.
But what does Ned Land think about all this?" "Ned Land's thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine," Conseil replied.
Indeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the solar world, rising and setting to the great planets like a simple morning or evening star!

"Look! Look!" the Canadian exclaimed, his voice full of excitement.
Our conversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans, and without going too far, I felt I could offer him this hope: Captain Nemo had gone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies.
We cannot be here and there too.
He was meditating out loud.
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
"For a very natural one," replied Barbicane.
HOBSON, Secretary of the Navy.
" I related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d'Urville had brought to light, deeds described here in this heavily condensed summary of the whole matter.
This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus's hull and corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the skiff.
"Well, it will not be enough.
Help was brought, tackle was let down, and they hoisted up, not without some trouble, the imprudent secretary of the Gun Club.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
"Because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis was not equal to her revolution, an equality which presents each part of her disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays.
But many centuries have passed since then, and this submerged volcano has changed into a peaceful cavern.
" "My friend," replied Barbicane, "the sea covers five-sixths of our globe.
" "In the name of the projectile!" exclaimed Michel Ardan, jumping as if it was already on the point of striking the terrestrial globe.
"A happy journey to you," exclaimed Michel Ardan, with a sigh of relief.
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
They did not again leave the scuttles, and noted every detail of this fantastical continent.
"But where does he get those millions?" Ned Land asked.
CHAPTER 16 Strolling the Plains THIS CELL, properly speaking, was the Nautilus's arsenal and wardrobe.
[Exeunt others of the Watch.
Maston, "must be big enough to attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are any?" "Yes," replied Barbicane, "and for another reason more important still.
