In fact, there could be no immediate danger.
O Scotland, Scotland Mal.
"Hurrah for Ardan! Hurrah for Barbicane! Hurrah for Nicholl!" rose to the skies.
For a museum it truly was, in which clever hands had spared no expense to amass every natural and artistic treasure, displaying them with the helter-skelter picturesqueness that distinguishes a painter's studio.
It was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling those occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi or Hudson rivers.

I had lost all sense of time.
Its fine-grained sand was followed by a genuine causeway of smooth crags covered by a carpet of mollusks and zoophytes.
Ned Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes.
When I burn this combustible to produce sodium, the smoke escaping from the mountain's crater gives it the appearance of a still-active volcano.
Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
Captain Nemo didn't put in an appearance.
Although the summer sun lavished its rays on us, we never suffered from the heat, because thirty or forty meters underwater, the temperature didn't go over 10 degrees to 12 degrees centigrade.
The whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea was a desert.
"Unfortunately," he went on, "I can't take you through that Suez Canal, but the day after tomorrow, you'll be able to see the long jetties of Port Said when we're in the Mediterranean.
In the latter case, the projectile would attain its maximum of speed; and in the former its minimum.
Starting this very day, you'll enter a new element, you'll see what no human being has ever seen before-- since my men and I no longer count--and thanks to me, you're going to learn the ultimate secrets of our planet.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death, And with his former Title greet Macbeth Rosse.
That day they gathered up some unusual specimens from these fish-filled waterways: anglerfish whose comical movements qualify them for the epithet "clowns," black Commerson anglers equipped with their antennas, undulating triggerfish encircled by little red bands, bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious, some olive-hued lampreys, snipefish covered with silver scales, cutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel and the electric ray, scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands, greenish codfish, several varieties of goby, etc.
CHAPTER XVII TYCHO At six in the evening the projectile passed the south pole at less than forty miles off, a distance equal to that already reached at the north pole.
Musicke, and a Song.
Absorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the duel, had seen and heard nothing.
But up to the present moment no direct communication has been established with her.
They were like suits of armor that were both yielding and resistant, you might say.
We all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to answer any attack.

Some, such as those of Paris, Petersburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares, Madras, and others, transmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained a prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result.
The Nautilus proceeded to midwater.
Carried by an inbound current, the longboat reached the island in a matter of moments.
Science has defined the global paths of five chief currents: one in the north Atlantic, a second in the south Atlantic, a third in the north Pacific, a fourth in the south Pacific, and a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean.
"Yes, we are.
In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited by a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up and decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into planets.
Tycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like Aristarchus and Copernicus; but it is of all the most complete and decided, showing unquestionably the frightful volcanic action to which the formation of the moon is due.
He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and human nature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of that one man than he did the applause of all the others.
Belfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, accompanying him.
Michel Ardan was right when he compared this map to a "Tendre card," got up by a Scudary or a Cyrano de Bergerac.
] Peter! Peter.
At meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern States, and consumed with an appetite that threatened speedy exhaustion of the victualing powers of Florida, fricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey, fish chowder, underdone 'possum, and raccoon steaks.
Why, what is Tybalt? Mer.
There wants but the hook to pull them out one by one.
Starting from this fact, some scientific men have seen in the moon a comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near to the earth that it will be held there by its attraction.
In 1,000 grams one finds 96.
Others looked like enormous amethysts, letting the light penetrate their insides.
"I don't see any fish!" "Why would you care, Ned my friend?" Conseil replied.
Consequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an appearance.
There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost regularity, connected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to them all simultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of gun-cotton was eventually to be ignited.
"The civilized world!" he said, shaking his head.
You are too hot.
Which would be an affront to Captain Nemo, since he hates to slay harmless beasts needlessly.
And I another 1.
"Twenty-four only," said Nicholl.
In addition to bananas, we gathered some enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor, some tasty mangoes, and some pineapples of unbelievable size.
I realized what had happened.
The ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats by the waves, and we soon arrived at some long, winding gradients, genuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little; but we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren't cemented together, and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte, made of feldspar and quartz crystals.
At that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of Michel Ardan, exclaiming in an accent of triumph: "White all, Barbicane, white all!" Barbicane, Michel Ardan, and Nicholl were playing at dominoes! CHAPTER XXIII THE END We may remember the intense sympathy which had accompanied the travelers on their departure.
A glass cover, six inches thick and strengthened with upper fastenings, closed it tightly.
Even or odd, of all days in the year, Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
There the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer to calculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his previous observations of hour angles.
But it isn't enough just to move, we have to see where we're going! We must be able to steer right or left, up or down! How do you reach the lower depths, where you meet an increasing resistance that's assessed in hundreds of atmospheres? How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean? Finally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you? Am I indiscreet in asking you all these things?" "Not at all, professor," the captain answered me after a slight hesitation, "since you'll never leave this underwater boat.
Conseil and Land spent the long hours with me.
A vague uneasiness took possession of them as they neared the end.
To deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer able to employ the means which had so ably weakened the shock at departure, that is to say, by water used as springs and the partition breaks.
Then drowsiness overtook me, I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress, and I fell into a deep slumber, while the Nautilus glided through the swiftly flowing Black Current.
It had cost $400,000.
It was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment itself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions; for they were already arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow strip of promontory.
Now then, since an engine is needed to generate that speed, and a mechanic to run that engine, I conclude: we're saved.
"With all due respect to master, they don't strike me as very wicked!" "They're cannibals even so, my boy.
This forecast fair weather.
The island was soon on view through the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its summits.
The light from our glass coils produced magical effects at times, lingering on the wrinkled roughness of some natural arch, or some overhang suspended like a chandelier, which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks.
He turned toward J.
That evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus's interior.
" "You said we'd be free aboard your vessel?" "Completely.
Among the books that make up my favorite reading, you'll find the work you've published on the great ocean depths.
Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie: it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion, equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye, leaues him Macd.

Thou sowre and firme-set Earth Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare Thy very stones prate of my where-about, And take the present horror from the time, Which now sutes with it.
It was past midnight; and Barbicane then estimated the distance at seven hundred and fifty miles, which was a little greater than the length of the lunar radius, and which would diminish as it advanced nearer to the North Pole.
If Captain Nemo let it approach, a chance for salvation might be available to us.
I dressed quickly.
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
One question, however, remained.
On the latter, there is but one slight strip of land separated from other continents by vast seas.
What, ho! They are all forth; well, I will walk myself To County Paris, to prepare him up Against to-morrow.
Well! starting from this principle, I ask myself whether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed upon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible to project a shot up to the moon?" At these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting chests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that profound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm.
"What is it?" "Come, speak!" "It is, simpletons," howled the terrible secretary, "it is that the projectile only weighs 19,250 pounds!" "Well?" "And that it displaces twenty-eight tons, or in other words 56,000 pounds, and that consequently _it floats_!" Ah! what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb "float!" And it was true! All, yes! all these savants had forgotten this fundamental law, namely, that on account of its specific lightness, the projectile, after having been drawn by its fall to the greatest depths of the ocean, must naturally return to the surface.
If a continent emerges at the pole, we'll stop at that continent.
My first concern was to look for the frigate.
I also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro, three decimeters long, bony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed with red spots; they're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables, which gives them an exquisite flavor; hence these tapiro were much in demand by the epicures of ancient Rome, and their entrails were dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo, and testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured the Roman emperor Vitellius.
Maston, was wasting his time, while leaning over the gigantic telescope he watched the course of the moon through the starry space.
Terror in fully active condition on the 167th meridian at latitude 77 degrees 32'.
" "And this explanation is the more probable," added Barbicane, "Because, in throwing off the water enclosed between its partition-breaks, the projectile found itself lightened of a considerable weight.
"I'm afraid I must be frank with master.
It's actually our work room, and there you'll learn the full story about the Nautilus!" CHAPTER 13 Some Figures A MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between our lips.
" "Then, sir, you assume they'll board the ship?" "I'm certain of it.
Romeo, son to Montague.
Land! And you, professor, kindly listen to me!" CHAPTER 10 The Man of the Waters IT WAS THE ship's commander who had just spoken.
This time there could be no mistake! A human voice had answered us! Was it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean, some other victim of that collision suffered by our ship? Or was it one of the frigate's longboats, hailing us out of the gloom? Conseil made one final effort, and bracing his hands on my shoulders, while I offered resistance with one supreme exertion, he raised himself half out of the water, then fell back exhausted.
That atmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity; nevertheless at the present day science generally admits that it exists.

However, during the day of March 16, these tracts of ice completely barred our path.
Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd, The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
They have in fact more regard for human nature in general than for the individual in particular.
The next day, March 19, at five o'clock in the morning, I was back at my post in the lounge.
"Five nights and four days!" I told my companions.
An opening left in the disc allowed them to light the match with which each was provided.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
Perhaps, again, on the other hand, it might be nearing it so much that in a short time it might strike some high point on the invisible hemisphere, which would doubtlessly have ended the journey much to the detriment of the travelers.
Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you may have other legal rights.
Equipped with picks, some ten men climbed onto the Nautilus's sides and cracked loose the ice around the ship's lower plating, which was soon set free.
This was an essential condition to the success of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the public attention.
By January 2 we had fared 11,340 miles, hence 5,250 leagues, from our starting point in the seas of Japan.
At that instant the projectile will have no weight whatever; and, if it passes that point, it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar attraction.
The heads of the maids? Samp.
I could hear the beat of its propeller, churning the waves with steady speed.
A Little Algebra V.
The constellations were glittering with startling intensity.
One single question remained to be solved.
How was he to invent anything to beat this 900-feet Columbiad? What armor-plate could ever resist a projectile of 30,000 pounds weight? Overwhelmed at first under this violent shock, he by and by recovered himself, and resolved to crush the proposal by weight of his arguments.
"When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer waters or by repeated collisions, its center of gravity rises.
A town built at the bottom of this circular cavity would have been utterly inaccessible.
"Face, indeed!" said Michel Ardan; "but I am sorry for the amiable sister of Apollo.
It seemed as if the moon might be touched by the hand! It seemed impossible that, before long, the projectile would not strike her, if only at the north pole, the brilliant arch of which was so distinctly visible on the black sky.
From the lounge, where I was writing up the incidents of this excursion to the polar continent, I could hear the calls of petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil.
" "And that's everything we know?" the Canadian asked.
The long snake was covered with seashell rubble and bristling with foraminifera; a crust of caked gravel protected it from any mollusks that might bore into it.

You could feel it in the vibrations of the long steel hull.
Heauen preserue you, I dare abide no longer.
From this moment on, for nineteen days from February 23 to March 12, the Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic, hustling us along at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty-four hours.
Violent squalls assaulted us during the daytime.

They imagined themselves walking through its unknown countries, climbing its highest peaks, descending into its lowest depths.
We shall therefore astonish the world by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt.
"Oh I do believe you! Let's forge ahead! There are no obstacles for us! Let's shatter this Ice Bank! Let's blow it up, and if it still resists, let's put wings on the Nautilus and fly over it!" "Over it, professor?" Captain Nemo replied serenely.
"I've heard about that picture.
" "Pooh!" cried J.
Some of the densities and volumes and masses don't >match up.
All this water contained a considerable amount, and after it was decomposed by our powerful batteries, this life-giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us.
Three o'clock then sounded.
From such slender threads hang the destinies of nations! I also observed some wonderful snappers belonging to the order Lutianida, sacred fish for the Greeks, who claimed they could drive off sea monsters from the waters they frequent; their Greek name anthias means "flower," and they live up to it in the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that turn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their hues are confined to a gamut of reds, from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby.

"Never mind! I wish I was there! Ah! my dear comrades, it will be rather curious to have the earth for our moon, to see it rise on the horizon, to recognize the shape of its continents, and to say to oneself, `There is America, there is Europe;' then to follow it when it is about to lose itself in the sun's rays! By the bye, Barbicane, have the Selenites eclipses?" "Yes, eclipses of the sun," replied Barbicane, "when the centers of the three orbs are on a line, the earth being in the middle.
Walruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the arrangement of their limbs.

Yes, that was a close call!" "If it's over with!" Ned Land muttered.
Then, picking up a piece of chalky stone, he advanced to a black basaltic rock and scrawled this one word: ATLANTIS What lightning flashed through my mind! Atlantis, that ancient land of Meropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus; Plato's Atlantis; the continent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers and scientists as Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus, d'Anville, Malte-Brun, and Humboldt, who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths and folk tales; the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted by such other thinkers as Posidonius, Pliny, Ammianus Marcellinus, Tertullian, Engel, Scherer, Tournefort, Buffon, and d'Avezac; I had this land right under my eyes, furnishing its own unimpeachable evidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it! So this was the submerged region that had existed outside Europe, Asia, and Libya, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, home of those powerful Atlantean people against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars! The writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic times is Plato himself.
We embraced each other heartily.

Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor.
This contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane, president of the Gun Club, of the one part, and T.
The truth is, that science is not favorably regarded in that country, it is still in a backward state; and moreover, certain Spaniards, not by any means the least educated, did not form a correct estimate of the bulk of the projectile compared with that of the moon.
" "I think so too," replied Barbicane; "that is why I propose to quadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.
I was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him, when on November 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned and Conseil, I found a note addressed to me on the table.
" Some well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first comprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself.
Then, following the captain's example, I let myself be crowned with my heavy copper sphere, and our air tanks immediately went into action.
There was nothing to be seen.
Also it's likely that a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up with certain large Asian lakes to form a single uniform expanse of water.
"Did we strike bottom?" I asked.
One unusual detail: his eyes were spaced a little far from each other and could instantly take in nearly a quarter of the horizon.
The admission of additional water was enough to shift its balance.
The liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps conceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters or crabs weighing 200 metric tons! Why not? Formerly, in prehistoric days, land animals (quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a gigantic scale.
" "Then see it we must, Conseil.
