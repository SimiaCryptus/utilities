Who's there? Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.
So he told the harpooner: "Ned my friend, you're a slayer of fish, a highly skilled fisherman.
But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an end, and no such end was in sight.
"Thirty-five!-- thirty-six!-- thirty-seven!-- thirty-eight!-- thirty-nine!-- forty! FIRE!!!" Instantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the electric battery, restored the current of the fluid, and discharged the spark into the breech of the Columbiad.
The last of these is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups, three classes of articulates, five classes of mollusks, and three vertebrate classes: mammals, reptiles, and those countless legions of fish, an infinite order of animals totaling more than 13,000 species, of which only one-tenth belong to fresh water.
My heart was pounding mightily.
"You wished to say a few more words?" he asked, in a pleasant voice.
"We are falling!" said he.
" And stretching himself on the divan, he soon snored like a forty-eight pounder.

That evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus's interior.
This magnificent radiance had to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity.
"But what can we do?" "Oh," he exclaimed, "if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand that much pressure without being crushed!" "Well?" I asked, not catching the captain's meaning.

"Ned Land can think, attempt, or endeavor anything he wants, what difference is it to me? I didn't go looking for him! I don't keep him on board for my pleasure! As for you, Professor Aronnax, you're a man able to understand anything, even silence.
The surface of the water was crisscrossed by a floating arbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant algae family that numbers more than 2,000 known species.
" "Correct," I replied.
People mistake them for islets.
Our host had kept to the terms of his agreement.
Although the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it apparently had hit only water.
"There is nothing to answer," said Nicholl.
But the Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern the fastest of these man-eaters.
After some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

"I should think so," said Michel Ardan.
He would have seen it as his sworn duty to destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly as a gigantic narwhale.
Six thousand millions! You quite understand?" "What is to be done then?" said the general.
" This logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection.
On January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters beneath the surface of the water.
At this point the excavation exhibited a depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun.
I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward, where its running lights were fading out in the distance.
" "Well," said michel, "that is an ingenious theory!" "And a true one, my worthy friend; for it explains every phenomenon of caloric.
The English Force, so please you Macb.
Conseil observed and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and fish.
Hunting otters in underwater forests, as we did in the forests of Crespo Island, is an acceptable activity.

Among the latter I observed a species of dogfish called the cow shark that's equipped with six respiratory slits, the telescope fish with its enormous eyes, the armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral fins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone, then finally the grenadier, living at a depth of 1,200 meters, by that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres.
7 meters of water and displacing 6,624 cubic meters.
Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them carried from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished stones their slings hurl with such dexterity.
"Did I ever try to bind you with your word of honor?" The captain stared at me, crossing his arms.
They hinted that the enterprise of the Gun Club was contrary to the "principle of non-intervention.
I went into the lounge.
He opened his eyes, sat up, took his two friends by the hands, and his first words were-- "Nicholl, are we moving?" Nicholl and Ardan looked at each other; they had not yet troubled themselves about the projectile; their first thought had been for the traveler, not for the car.
Had the Nautilus left the surface of the ocean? Was it reentering the motionless strata deep in the sea? I tried to fight off this drowsiness.
At noon the sun made a momentary appearance.
Then, laden with these valuable spoils, the men returned to the Nautilus, dropped off their burdens inside, and went to resume this inexhaustible fishing for silver and gold.
There, between its leaflike folds, I saw a loose pearl as big as a coconut.
My clothes were weighing me down.

His heart must have been throbbing with intense excitement.
" "Electricity!" I exclaimed in some surprise.

This boat is a masterpiece of modern technology, and I'd be sorry to have missed it! Many people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us, just to walk in the midst of these wonders.
Besides, I use my supplementary ballast tanks only to reach an average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters, and that with a view to conserving my machinery.
Would I could answer This comfort with the like.

The moon rose above the horizon.
" "But which volcanic mountain is this?" I asked.

" "They're seals and walruses.
What was this astounding world that I didn't yet know? In what order did these articulates belong, these creatures for which the rocks provided a second carapace? Where had nature learned the secret of their vegetating existence, and for how many centuries had they lived in the ocean's lower strata? But I couldn't linger.
Near one o'clock, Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt.
Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon What hath chanc'd: and at more time, The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake Our free Hearts each to other Banq.
We shall run no danger of an explosion; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire instantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete.
It was obvious to me that this Mediterranean, pinned in the middle of those shores he wanted to avoid, gave Captain Nemo no pleasure.
Commander Bouguer approached the animal and attacked it with blows from harpoons and blasts from rifles, but without much success because bullets and harpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it were semiliquid jelly.
We were facing the island of Vanikoro proper, to which Captain Dumont d'Urville had given the name "Island of the Search"; we lay right in front of the little harbor of Vana, located in latitude 16 degrees 4' south and longitude 164 degrees 32' east.
They're right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by chance a shell's spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight in gold for it.

Meaning, to cursy.
Perhaps I would never learn who he was, where he came from or where he was heading, but more and more I could see a distinction between the man and the scientist.
It was eleven o'clock, and if Captain Nemo found conditions favorable for taking his sights, I wanted to be present at the operation.
I was about to go below to alert them, when the chief officer climbed onto the platform.
Outside was perfect silence; but the thick padding was enough to intercept all sounds coming from the earth.

The mollusk's two valves were partly open.
One might have heard the beating of their hearts amid this perfect silence.
It was likely that they had come from neighboring islands or from the mainland of Papua proper.

"Very well, let it bust up!" replied the Floridans, with a brevity of the days of ancient Sparta.
It was a high-speed frigate furnished with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam to build to seven atmospheres.
I walked up and down, hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement.
O, he's a lovely gentleman! Romeo's a dishclout to him.
From then on, no more mollusks, no more zoophytes, no more articulates.

"We sincerely believed in master's narwhale.
If navigation ever existed on the surface of the moon, it must have been wonderfully difficult and dangerous; and we may well pity the Selenite sailors and hydrographers; the former, when they came upon these perilous coasts, the latter when they took the soundings of its stormy banks.
"Even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice, its lower strata are still open, thanks to that divine justice that puts the maximum density of salt water one degree above its freezing point.
It was only a fleeting glimmer, but its effect was indescribable.
This buoy shone under the rays of the sun as if it had been made of plates of silver.
Now then, those Testacea capable of producing pearls include rainbow abalone, turbo snails, giant clams, and saltwater scallops--briefly, all those that secrete mother-of-pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white substance lining the insides of their valves.
But his anger was diverted by the sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled alongside of just then.
Now then, since these ice mountains don't exceed a height of 100 meters, they sink only to a depth of 300 meters.
It was barely able to walk.
"Sir," Ned Land told me, "if that boat gets within a mile of us, I'm jumping overboard, and I suggest you follow suit.
At eight o'clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves, and its huge curls were lifting little by little.
President Barbicane knew not which way to look.
" "What!" exclaimed Barbicane, starting; "you say----" "Twelve thousand yards.
" "Without taking into account," Ned answered, "that once we're out of this damned prison, we'll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank, without any possible contact with the open air!" An apt remark.
No more than the collisions it caused.
Hoisted on board, the longboat was readjusted into its socket, and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves.
They pointed out to them that the firmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one vast dial-plate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time to all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is during this movement that the Queen of Night exhibits her different phases; that the moon is _full_ when she is in _opposition_ with the sun, that is when the three bodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the center; that she is _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the sun, that is, when she is between it and the earth; and, lastly that she is in her _first_ or _last_ quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth an angle of which she herself occupies the apex.
The breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to the liquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig, prepared from the best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas.
There our diving suits were removed, not without difficulty; and utterly exhausted, faint from lack of food and rest, I repaired to my stateroom, full of wonder at this startling excursion on the bottom of the sea.
" "Is there any truth in this hypothesis?" asked Michel.
Captain Nemo was waiting for me.
Maston, Major Elphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of the club, to the number of ten in all.

At this point the sorters begin their twofold task.
In any case, there was no time for explanations.

They were rings of clouds placed concentrically round the terrestrial globe.
The Nautilus then rolled and pitched like a ship left to the fury of the elements.
"Done, my captain!" replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl's hand.
I must to the learned.
In front of them was a piece of artillery ready to give fire on the signal from the engineer.
It was a ringed mountain nine thousand feet high, and one of those circles so numerous on this satellite.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
"Well, then, my friend, do not expose yourself," answered Barbicane, "for the hand that you draw in again will be nothing but a stump frozen and deformed by the frightful cold.
" "All right, Ned, let's wait and see!" I replied.
" "But still, nine dollars a pound!" replied the major, who was not willing readily to give in; "even that is an enormous price.
Each one brought forward his own contingent of particular facts; Barbicane and Nicholl always serious, Michel Ardan always enthusiastic.
At Paris, The Credit Mobilier.
This projectile has not arrived at its destination.
Then, a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament, bordered by a silvery cord; it was the earth! Here and there nebulous masses like large flakes of starry snow; and from the zenith to the nadir, an immense ring formed by an impalpable dust of stars, the "Milky Way," in the midst of which the sun ranks only as a star of the fourth magnitude.
"For the reason that `he is always brave who never suspects danger.
Soon we were imprisoned up to the neck in india-rubber clothing, and straps fastened the air devices onto our backs.
Besides, it's unwise to carry electric lanterns under these waves.
Moreover, to renew our air supply, the submersible rose to the surface of the waves only at night, and relying solely on compass and log, it steered by dead reckoning.
The screw had been shipped, and the whole power of the machinery collected on the capstan would have quickly drawn the apparatus on board.
Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no memory, they were quite startled to be back in their cabin.
Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.
"Yes, sometimes," the captain replied.

, after strictly informing them not to open his prison before the 20th, at six o'clock P.
Then I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo's strange facial seizure kept haunting me.
A terrific east wind swept away the groups of clouds which had been so long gathering, and at night the semi-disc of the orb of night rode majestically amid the soft constellations of the sky.
As for the savages, they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning, when the heads of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide.
Now then, we've been buried beneath the waters for thirty-six hours, and the Nautilus's heavy atmosphere already needs renewing.
Until tomorrow then.
I lost track of the passing hours.
Its deck was covered with dark, quivering shadows.
" "Unless, by any chance," answered Nicholl, "the atmosphere should be condensed on the other side, as certain astronomers pretend.
The new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co.
Speake if you can: what are you? 1.
Farewell, [sings] lady, lady, lady.
Barbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks, enclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of the projectile.
The latter, as you see, have dark nights of 354 hours, without one single ray to break the darkness.
O Romeo, Romeo! Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! Jul.
The different pieces were fitted without trouble, it being only a matter of bolts and screws; tools were not wanting, and soon the reinstated disc lay on steel plugs, like a table on its legs.

I neither know it nor can learn of him Ben.
Then, going on: "Salts," he said, "fill the sea in considerable quantities, professor, and if you removed all its dissolved saline content, you'd create a mass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues, which if it were spread all over the globe, would form a layer more than ten meters high.
Its apparent immovability, and the want of communication with the outside, prevented them from solving the question.
" "That's right," I said, "I am a doctor, I used to be on call at the hospitals.
O well done: I commend your paines, And euery one shall share i'th' gaines: And now about the Cauldron sing Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring, Inchanting all that you put in.
"It is an impossible supposition," said the practical Barbicane; "unless that impulsive force had failed; but even then its speed would diminish by degrees, and it would not have stopped suddenly.
His moods grew gloomier and gloomier.
"The problem before us," continued the president, "is how to communicate to a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second.
On doubts being expressed as to the correctness of this method, they immediately proved that not only was the mean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers could not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy miles either way.
During this navigating in the midst of the ice, Captain Nemo often stayed on the platform.
The white petals retracted into their red sheaths, the flowers vanished before my eyes, and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples.
"But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?" Ned Land went on.
In the center stood an upright wheel geared to rudder cables running to the Nautilus's stern.
I realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea.
Just then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut short the harpooner's proposition.
In any event, every morning we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air.
But how sad, despairing, and irresolute he must have felt, to judge from this ship whose soul he was, which reflected his every mood! The Nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading.
Maston, more radiant than the midday sun, and nearly as ruddy.
Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism.
You will, I am sure, readily admit this superiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say nothing of his years, which each equal twelve of ours! Under such auspices and such marvelous conditions of existence, it appears to me that the inhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every respect superior to ourselves.
He then quitted Baltimore, accompanied by J.
I wanted to take him with me.
If they stretched out their arms, they did not attempt to fall.
Take it in what sense thou wilt.
Several times the platform seemed seized with pitching and rolling like a weatherbeaten ship.
The Nautilus was motionless.
Yet for the imaginings of these storytellers there had to be, if not a cause, at least an excuse.
The day you're ready, alert us and we're with you.
Most people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the Federal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships.
Consequently, it's pointless to argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a case.
Everything through Electricity 58 13.
"Wonderful fellows!" muttered Ardan.
An induction coil gathers the electricity generated and directs it to a specially designed lantern.
Through the lounge's open windows, I saw large, frightened fish passing like phantoms in the fiery waters.
"Open sea!" he told me.
I struggled against being dragged into the depths.
The ceiling lights in the lounge then went out, the panels opened, and through the windows I saw, for a half-mile radius, the sea brightly lit by the beacon's rays.
As for his chief officer, the same applied.
The place chosen for this monster meeting was a vast plain situated in the rear of the town.
Some gigantic devilfish maybe.
It was a fine catch but not surprising.
I found it excellent, even better than veal if not beef.
It was ten in the morning; the corvette was under half-steam, as it was regretting to leave the spot where the catastrophe had taken place, when a sailor, perched on the main-top-gallant crosstrees, watching the sea, cried suddenly: "A buoy on the lee bow!" The officers looked in the direction indicated, and by the help of their glasses saw that the object signalled had the appearance of one of those buoys which are used to mark the passages of bays or rivers.
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
The proposition being accepted, the shape of the projectile was slightly altered.
First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages-- to Britain, America, the Mediterranean.
Your Nemo's veering away from shore and heading up north.
Are you a man? Macb.
We kept rising on a diagonal, going along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays.
The sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger, shedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried in the heart of this extinct mountain.
Never had the crew of an American naval craft shown more patience and zeal; they weren't responsible for this failure; there was nothing to do but go home.
Leaving the Nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed, a rash move if there ever was one.
A dreadful battle was joined.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
O worthyest Cousin, The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me.
The eye, dazzled as if it was leaning over a bath of molten silver, turned from it involuntarily; but the oblong form of the orb was quite clear.
" Two miles farther on, we were stopped by a promontory that screened the bay from southerly winds.
The electric log indicated that the Nautilus had reduced speed.
Barbicane found that this point would be reached at one in the morning on the night of the 7th-8th of December.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
"Very well; with all those pieces of lava lengthened like rockets, it resembles an immense game of spelikans thrown pellmell.
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

Let us be off to breakfast!" CHAPTER XXII THE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES That same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and President Barbicane, as well as its singular _denouement_.
Captain Nemo, arms crossed over his chest, knelt in a posture of prayer, as did all the friends of him who had loved them.
My mind was completely wrapped up in my memories of the pole.
"Hmm!" I said to myself.
Look, look! O heavy day! Mother.
Therefore have done.
" "We must have," said Maston, "several touch-holes, so as to fire it at different points at the same time.
Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber? Lady.
We mustn't push our luck and expose the Nautilus too long to these pressures.
The latter did not even take the pains to refute the arguments of his rival.
" "What's that?" "It's because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his people is now so clogged with sand, camels can barely get their legs wet.
" In a single month after its formation it numbered 1,833 effective members and 30,565 corresponding members.
Indeed, the projectile's course was being traced between the earth and the moon.
I found a place near him and waited without speaking.

Quickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one last and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries.
I would the fool were married to her grave! Cap.
He also observed that if the projectile did not succeed in reaching its destination (a result absolutely impossible), it must inevitably fall back upon the earth, and that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by the square of its velocity, would seriously endanger every point of the globe.
As for our craft, it no longer stirred, staying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled it in with their indestructible cement.
"Yes, Nicholl; but however little it might be," replied Barbicane, "in a distance of 84,000 leagues, it wanted no more to make us miss the moon.
Suddenly, all the way from the dark horizon where it had gone to gather momentum, the monster abruptly dashed toward the Abraham Lincoln with frightening speed, stopped sharply twenty feet from our side plates, and died out-- not by diving under the water, since its glow did not recede gradually-- but all at once, as if the source of this brilliant emanation had suddenly dried up.
At these words Ned Land stood up quickly.
Monstrous waves race together from every point of the horizon.
Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men, and hang vp them Wife.
The craft that Cook was aboard charged into some coral rock, and if his vessel didn't go down, it was thanks to the circumstance that a piece of coral broke off in the collision and plugged the very hole it had made in the hull.
MASTON RECALLED "It is `they' come back again!" the young midshipman had said, and every one had understood him.
And be all Traitors, that do so Wife.

And to the eyes of the travelers there reappeared that original aspect of the lunar landscapes, raw in tone, without gradation of colors, and without degrees of shadow, roughly black and white, from the want of diffusion of light.
So at thirty-two feet beneath the surface of the sea, you'll undergo a pressure of 17,568 kilograms; at 320 feet, or ten times greater pressure, it's 175,680 kilograms; at 3,200 feet, or 100 times greater pressure, it's 1,756,800 kilograms; finally, at 32,000 feet, or 1,000 times greater pressure, it's 17,568,000 kilograms; in other words, you'd be squashed as flat as if you'd just been yanked from between the plates of a hydraulic press!" "Fire and brimstone!" Ned put in.
We had fared 17,000 leagues, and as Ned Land put it, there was no end in sight.
"But may I address a question to you?" "You may not, sir.
There is the "Sea of Serenity," over which the young girl bends; "The Lake of Dreams," reflecting a joyous future; "The Sea of Nectar," with its waves of tenderness and breezes of love; "The Sea of Fruitfulness;" "The Sea of Crises;" then the "Sea of Vapors," whose dimensions are perhaps a little too confined; and lastly, that vast "Sea of Tranquillity," in which every false passion, every useless dream, every unsatisfied desire is at length absorbed, and whose waves emerge peacefully into the "Lake of Death!" What a strange succession of names! What a singular division of the moon's two hemispheres, joined to one another like man and woman, and forming that sphere of life carried into space! And was not the fantastic Michel right in thus interpreting the fancies of the ancient astronomers? But while his imagination thus roved over "the seas," his grave companions were considering things more geographically.
This peculiarity was due to their regularly decreasing speed.
Capulet's house.
At the same time, on one of the highest points of the Rocky Mountains, the Gun Club had a gigantic telescope erected, in order that they might be able to follow the course of the projectile through space.
The fare for the descent was fixed at five dollars per head; and despite this high charge, during the two months which preceded the experiment, the influx of visitors enabled the Gun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand dollars! It is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the members of the Gun Club.
Among bony fish, I noted grizzled wrasse unique to these seas, deep-water gilthead whose iris has a fiery gleam, one-meter croakers whose large mouths bristle with small teeth and which let out thin cries, black rudderfish like those I've already discussed, blue dorados accented with gold and silver, rainbow-hued parrotfish that can rival the loveliest tropical birds in coloring, banded blennies with triangular heads, bluish flounder without scales, toadfish covered with a crosswise yellow band in the shape of a Greek t, swarms of little freckled gobies stippled with brown spots, lungfish with silver heads and yellow tails, various specimens of salmon, mullet with slim figures and a softly glowing radiance that Lacépčde dedicated to the memory of his wife, and finally the American cavalla, a handsome fish decorated by every honorary order, bedizened with their every ribbon, frequenting the shores of this great nation where ribbons and orders are held in such low esteem.
