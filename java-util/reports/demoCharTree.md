This will demonstrate how to use the CharTrieIndex class for PPM and shared dictionary compression


First, we load some data into an index:

Code: 
```java
      CharTrieIndex charTrieIndex = new CharTrieIndex();
      WikiArticle.load().limit(100).forEach(article -> {
          charTrieIndex.addDocument(article.getText());
      });
      charTrieIndex.index(5, 1);
      return charTrieIndex;
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.CharTrieIndex@6e8e4a0d
```
And then derive a PPM codec:

Code: 
```java
      return trie.getCodec();
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.PPMCodec@2b4a2ec7
```


Then, we use it to encode strings:

Code: 
```java
      return WikiArticle.load().skip(100)
              .filter(article -> article.getText().length() > 1024 && article.getText().length() < 4096)
              .findFirst().get();
```
Returns: 
```
    WikiArticle{title='Ada'}
```
Code: 
```java
      Bits bits = codec.encodePPM(wikiArticle.getText(), 2);
      System.out.print("Bit Length: " + bits.bitLength);
      return bits.toBase64String();
```
Returns: 
```
