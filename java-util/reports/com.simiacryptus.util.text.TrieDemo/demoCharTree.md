This will demonstrate how to use the CharTrieIndex class for PPM and shared dictionary compression


First, we load some data into an index:

Code from [..\..\..\src\test\java\com\simiacryptus\util\text\TrieDemo.java:72](TrieDemo.java#L72) 33.830727 seconds: 
```java
      CharTrieIndex charTrieIndex = new CharTrieIndex();
      WikiArticle.load().limit(100).forEach(article -> {
          charTrieIndex.addDocument(article.getText());
      });
      charTrieIndex.index(5, 1);
      return charTrieIndex;
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.CharTrieIndex@94705d86
```

And then derive a PPM codec:

Code from [..\..\..\src\test\java\com\simiacryptus\util\text\TrieDemo.java:81](TrieDemo.java#L81) 3.795067 seconds: 
```java
      return trie.getCodec();
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.PPMCodec@704921a5
```



Then, we use it to encode strings:

Code from [..\..\..\src\test\java\com\simiacryptus\util\text\TrieDemo.java:86](TrieDemo.java#L86) 0.027743 seconds: 
```java
      return WikiArticle.load().skip(100)
              .filter(article -> article.getText().length() > 1024 && article.getText().length() < 4096)
              .findFirst().get();
```
Returns: 
```
    WikiArticle{title='Ada'}
```

Code from [..\..\..\src\test\java\com\simiacryptus\util\text\TrieDemo.java:92](TrieDemo.java#L92) 0.082297 seconds: 
```java
      Bits bits = codec.encodePPM(wikiArticle.getText(), 2);
      System.out.print("Bit Length: " + bits.bitLength);
      return bits.toBase64String();
```
Returns: 
```
