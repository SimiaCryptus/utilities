This will demonstrate how to use the CharTrieIndex class for PPM and shared dictionary compression


First, we load some data into an index:

Code from [TrieDemo.java:72](../../../src/test/java/com/simiacryptus/util/text/TrieDemo.java#L72) executed in 33.673410 seconds: 
```java
      CharTrieIndex charTrieIndex = new CharTrieIndex();
      WikiArticle.load().limit(100).forEach(article -> {
          charTrieIndex.addDocument(article.getText());
      });
      charTrieIndex.index(5, 1);
      return charTrieIndex;
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.CharTrieIndex@74191526
```

And then derive a PPM codec:

Code from [TrieDemo.java:81](../../../src/test/java/com/simiacryptus/util/text/TrieDemo.java#L81) executed in 4.319383 seconds: 
```java
      return trie.getCodec();
```
Returns: 
```
    com.simiacryptus.util.text.PPMCodec@5204062d
```



Then, we use it to encode strings:

Code from [TrieDemo.java:86](../../../src/test/java/com/simiacryptus/util/text/TrieDemo.java#L86) executed in 0.027682 seconds: 
```java
      return WikiArticle.load().skip(100)
              .filter(article -> article.getText().length() > 1024 && article.getText().length() < 4096)
              .findFirst().get();
```
Returns: 
```
    WikiArticle{title='Ada'}
```

Code from [TrieDemo.java:92](../../../src/test/java/com/simiacryptus/util/text/TrieDemo.java#L92) executed in 0.075475 seconds: 
```java
      Bits bits = codec.encodePPM(wikiArticle.getText(), 2);
      System.out.print("Bit Length: " + bits.bitLength);
      return bits.toBase64String();
```
Returns: 
```

For faster compression, we can define a dictionary for use with Deflate:
